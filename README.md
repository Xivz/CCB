# CCB
or crosschatbot

this bot is used for barebones server-server (as well as channel-channel in just one server) communication, and is made with the intent that the person who uses the bot, is also hosting the bot themselves.

## Usage
in order to use ccb for your own server, you must create your own bot/application at https://discord.com/developers/applications and host it yourself. there are no plans for a public bot.
